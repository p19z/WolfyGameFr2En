# When using text editors on Windows, the .gitattributes and .gitignore
# files are often created with CRLF line endings in the first place.

# Having tools automatically generate the .gitmodules file with LF line
# endings, and not specifying here that this is expected, would cause
# warnings upon all checkins on Windows, until an explicit checkout is
# performed. Although those warnings would be harmless, and that finally
# having, at some point, the .gitmodules file checked out with CRLF line
# endings on Windows, we still favor the standard, Unix-style, format.
# + REMARK: Those configuration files can be located in subdirectories.

/.gitmodules text eol=lf
.gitmodules text eol=lf

# Do not modify line ending of typical Unix-style scripts bash scripts.

*.pl text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf

# Do not modify line ending of standard shell outputs and error outputs.

*.sh.stderr text eol=lf
*.sh.stdout text eol=lf

# Do not modify line ending of typical Microsoft Windows-only files.
